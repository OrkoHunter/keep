# A Meta CLI toolkit

> Your personal shell command keeper

## Why?

Writwick Wraj loves using the command line.

Writwick googles \"How to do X in terminal?\" and multiple forums and
blog posts finally provide him the magical _command_ for the rescue.
Problem Solved !

Fast forward couple weeks, Writwick has to do X in terminal, again. Wraj
remembers solving this few weeks ago. Let him do a reverse-i-search with
_Ctrl+R_. Nope, can\'t remember sh\*t. Browser search history? 25 web
pages found matching _X_. Argh!

Writwik finally finds the solution. From this time Writwik starts
writing the commands somewhere online for the future.

Wait, why shouldn\'t he keep the command in his terminal itself if this
is only place where he\'ll ever have use it?

## Features

it with your local machine.**
